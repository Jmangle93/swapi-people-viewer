# Front-End React Development Experiments with SWAPI

** Swapi.dev
- StarWars API has JS, TS, and other helpful wrappers - this app is simply an exploration in custom React front-end, and I may or may not choose to use them.
- Primary goals include learning React, solidifying JS/TS knowledge, and applying design principles

** Current features
- Search the name of a Star Wars character from the films to view their species and appearances
- Intended features include searching by film and updated css styles
